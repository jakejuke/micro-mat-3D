# Quadratic Equations for GB Mobilities

Using the quadratic formula
$$ f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c $$
we can create a simple function to relate the GB mobility to misorientation.

| *Quadratic functions that pass through $(0,0)$, are positive between $0 \leq x \leq 1$ and have a maximum value of $1$.* |

To meet these conditons, there is only one independent variable $a$, the range of which is limited.
$$ -4 \leq a \leq -1$$

The 1st and 2nd derivatives of $f(x)$ are:

$$ f'(x) = 2ax + b $$

$$ f''(x) = 2a $$

For a maximum, the 2nd derivative must be negative. This implies that $a$ must be negative.
